## Thoughts

Building TicTacToe was something I dreamt of doing since I learn how to code. To me know how to build this game shows a solid foundation of language and OOP.

I started buliding basic functions such as insert player move and insert computer move. Then I put it all into a model object and fix any scoping problems.

Then I build my event handlers making sure clicking each button would add a symbol to the board and begin turning console.log display to HTML display.

Finally I added the view and CSS to my html. I also added animate.css to the game.
